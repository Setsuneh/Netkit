<b> What is Netkit? </b>
------
</br>

Netkit is an environment for setting up and performing networking experiments at low cost and with little effort. It allows to "create" several virtual network devices (full-fledged routers, switches, computers, etc.) that can be easily interconnected in order to form a network on a single PC. 
Networking equipments are virtual but feature many of the characteristics of the real ones, including the configuration interface.
